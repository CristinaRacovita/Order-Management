# Order-Management
  In this app I use:
- connection to a database for storing datas.
- Reflection tehnique for creating and populating tables used on app.
# Introduction
  This application processes customer orders for a deposit. Relational databases are used to store products, customers and orders. CRUD operations are implemented for the database.
# Pre-requisites
  - This app is independent of operating system, but it needs Java.
  - Make deserialization first, to add products to the menu. After this, you can comment these lines of code, and make serialization for saving products that will be added.
# Getting Started
  1. Download code.
  2. Open code in a Java IDE (like Eclipse or Intellij)
  3. Run the app.
